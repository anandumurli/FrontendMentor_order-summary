## My process

Started with the skeleton html. Gave html a height of 100vh, then gave body a height of 100%. This way using 
```css
body{
    display: flex; 
    align-items: center;
    justify-content:center
}
``` 
helped put the whole thing in vertical center position.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox


### What I learned

The background was two portion, one was the background image asset, and the color. Learned how one can easily make fancy designs by creating one svg file and then using background color. 


### Continued development

Want to start using custom variables in css.
